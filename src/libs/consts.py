    'HELP': 'Hello, young trainer. My name is *Jigglypuff* and i would like to help you locate all pokemons near you. Here i would like to answer some quations.Let\'s start\n\n*1*.How i can recieve pokemon\'s location?:\nYou should send your lacation from media selection\n*2*.Why search perfomance is very poor?:\nCause the machine, that my master use, has a poor perfomance too.\n*3*.I sent my location, but progress still on 0. What happend?:\nProbably, Pokemon\'s servers are down,u should wait for some minutes or hours.\n*4*.When searching is over, i didn\'t get a map. Why?:\nProbably, your district is down, launch a game and check, for any pokestops and "Nearby" sceen. If u can\'t see them, there is a answer.\n\nSo, I hope you will enjoy my work and you will catch all pokemons, Good luck!!!\n\n[Source code](https://github.com/NeXidan/jigglypuff)'
